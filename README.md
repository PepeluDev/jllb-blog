# Blog website

Currently a WIP.

This is a POC repository to learn Next.js, and at the same time code a blog
to share knowledge about techy stuff that I face on a daily basis at my
work as a cloud software developer.

Currently it is inspired by the [Next.js] official tutorial. Posts
are staticaly generated from *.md* files using "gray-matter" and
"next-mdx-remote".
